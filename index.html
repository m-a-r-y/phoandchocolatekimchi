Everything was coming at you and at me, and we were just coming at each other, bumping heads. I started to feel like as if we didn't even know each other anymore, and yet we have lost the novelty and excitement of discovering each other. We fell into this routine of simply being physically present and doing things together, but not actually connecting mentally or internally.</p>

            <p class="p-space">There were times when I wanted to talk to you about how I felt but I just couldn't find the words to say while I was with you - there were always little distractions. I thought those quiet evening walks could help me open up but there was this disconnect and I was afraid and nervous to bring anything up, not wanting to ruin the present moment; the walk was just for you and me, no phones or tv or anything else that could enter our quality time.</p>
            
            <p class="p-space">Real quality time. Free of technological distractions, Netflix, social media, games... etc. This was something we didn't have that during this time, but it was something had in abundance in the beginning, it made me fall in love with you inside your SUV over the weekends we spent camping outside listening to music and enjoying each other's company. Despite all that was going on between us during that time, that was all I wanted, you and me.</p>

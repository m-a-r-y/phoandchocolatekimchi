Everything was coming at you and at me, and we were just coming at each other, bumping heads. I started to feel like as if we didn't even know each other anymore, and yet we have lost the novelty and initial excitement of discovering each other. You and I were both drifting further and further away from each other. We fell into this routine of simply being physically present and doing things together, but not actually connecting mentally, emotionally, or intellectually, and all the while being unhappy with our current situation.</p>

            <p class="p-space">There were times when I wanted to talk to you about how I felt but I just couldn't find the words to say while I was with you - there were always little distractions. I thought those quiet evening walks could help me open up but there was this disconnect between us and I was afraid and nervous to bring anything up, not wanting to ruin the present moment; the walk was just for you and me, no phones or tv or anything else that could enter our quality time.</p>

            <p class="p-space">That was what we desperately needed - free of technological distractions, Netflix, social media, games... etc. This was something we didn't have that during this time but was something that we had in abundance in the beginning; it made me fall in love with you inside your SUV over the weekends we spent camping outside listening to music and enjoying each other's company. Despite all that was going on between us during that time, that was all I really wanted, you and me.</p>

Thank you for the most emotionally eventful year, helping me learn and experience new things that I never would have imagined otherwise. I love having you by my side though all of it, thank you for being my main man and for finding and lifting my heart.</p>

            <p class="p-space">I am excied for next year with you! It will be a good year for the both of us! Just wait and see. I have a good feeling about it :) can’t wait to spend 2017 with you <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-heart red" aria-hidden="true"></span></p>

Time feels infinite whenever I am with you and it is a feeling of being totally comfortable and at home whenever we are together. It's nice knowing that we will continue to live many lifetimes as the years go by. </p>
